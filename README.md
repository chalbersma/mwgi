MWGI (Mid-west Guy Index)
=========================

MWGI v2
-------

This is the public repo for the reboot of the MWGI. I know we crashed and burned
after btct shutdown (and most of my developement was on btct). But were back and
better than ever. Hopefully we can get a working model going with some of the
available exchanges and then write interfaces to get colored coins up and
running when it goes live here in a few.

Any help will be appreciated.
